## Overview

This project aims to implement a machine learning model that can accurately classify emails as either spam or ham. The project uses datasets that contain labeled emails and employs classification algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or Decision Trees. Advanced versions may use deep learning models with TensorFlow or PyTorch.

## Technologies

- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib (optional for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebooks (optional for development)
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (optional for deep learning models)
